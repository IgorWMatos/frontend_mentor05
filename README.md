## My process

The first step of this project was to mentally build the HTML structure with its semantics, and how everything that was offered in this challenge would fit. Only then, I tagged and inserted images as to follow the images with the challenges design.

Once everything was set, I utilized SCSS to stylize and shape the designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

the most challenging process in this project was to put the image out of the frame. As the project was larger than the previous one, I've noticed the importance of managing time and a personal deadline.
